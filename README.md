# Blog application

- Written with Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring MVC, Spring Security, MySQL, HTML, JUnit.
- To start the app you need to run "BlogApplication.java" file with local server (localhost:8082), also you need to have MySQL connected to this localhost. The applications to obtain this are Open Server (for Windows) and MAMP (both MacOS and Windows). If you use MAMP you could google datasource's name and password and change it in application.properties and application-test.properties files.
- Testing the app is provided by JUnit and integration tests. JUnit tests are located in test.java....controllers directory. Integration tests are testing login page. They could be found in test.java.LoginTest.java file. To use them you should do the same you've done to start the app.
